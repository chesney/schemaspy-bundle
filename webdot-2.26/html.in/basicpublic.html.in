<font color="darkred">Notice: Although webdot can still be configured as a public server, we no longer provide such a server ourselves and we don't recommend
that others do so either.  Webdot contains no mechanisms for limiting the load
on a public server.  Instead we recommend that you set up a server just for
your own graphs.
</font>
<p>
If a public WebDot server is available then graphs can be served without
installing WebDot locally.  For example, if there is a graph at:
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/demo.dot">http://www.graphviz.org/demo.dot</a>
<p>
then this img tag in an html web page:
<table border="1"><tr><td><pre>
&lt;img src="http://webdot.graphviz.org/cgi-bin/webdot<b>/http://www.graphviz.org/demo.dot</b>.dot<b>.png</b>"
    alt="graph from public webdot server"&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
will produce the graph layout at the top of this page.
