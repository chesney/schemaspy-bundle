Similarly to the support for client-side maps, WebDot can filter an
html page and replace all occurrences of &lt;webdot...&gt; tags
with a client-side SVG image.

For example, $SELF.dot contains:
$DOT
and the source of this page contains:
<table border="1"><tr><td><pre>
&lt;webdot src="$BASE/$SELF.dot" engine="neato" type="svg"&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
which serving through $CGIBASE replaces the &lt;webdot...&gt; tag. 
To see the result please view the source of this page.
<p>
The advantages of this mode of WebDot are the much simpler authoring and
the responsiveness of client-side mapping.
<p>
The disadvantages are that the html source now contains non-standard markup and
the page has to be served through the $CGIBASE program.
Care must be taken that relative URLs in the html don't also get served
through the WebDot cgi program so it is important to use "rooted" hrefs
in documents and graphs served this way.
<p>
Embedded SVG is probably a better choice.
